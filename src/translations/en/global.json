        "aboutMe2": " At the beginning of 2022 I decided to turn my professional career around, and doing a Web Development Bootcamp was, without a doubt, the best decision I could make. It was hard but I was able to finish it successfully, making a final project that I am proud of. In it I used technologies such as React.js for the frontend and Node.js, Express.js for the backend, with MongoDb as DB system.",
        "aboutMe3": "I have several years of experience as a product photographer and digital editing that have helped me to master concepts of color and composition that I apply in web design. For this I use CSS and libraries like Bootstrap or MUI.",
